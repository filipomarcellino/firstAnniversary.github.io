          <h1>Happy 1st Anniversary, baby!</h1>
          <p>
            It's officially been a year since meeting at production way! I still
            remember vividly the first autumn we met, the rain, the cute dates
            we did. The pho, the arcade, the christmas lights, the thanksgiving
            with my friends, the puzzle and baking, the sleepovers. And of
            course we had the sunny season! The beach, the clubbing, going out
            with felis and alex, the weekly sunday mass. The trips we had with
            ory, the random park visits, the library visits. I really
            cherish those moments we had because it marked the start of this
            very beautiful (and hopefully everlasting) relationship that we
            have.
          </p>
          <p>
            As we celebrate this special day, I want you to know how deeply you
            are loved and how grateful I am to have you by my side. I look
            forward to many more years of memories, laughter, and love.
            <br />
            <br />
            We know that this relationship takes effort from both of us and we
            will face shakiness in the future. But I believe that if we let God
            take control of our relationship, we can be together until the end
            of our lives, even after death.
            <br />
            Here's to many more anniversaries, food and laugther memories, and
            love!
          </p>
          <p>
            Forever yours,
            <br />
            PIPO
